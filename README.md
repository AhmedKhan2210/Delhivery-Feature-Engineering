# Key Insights & Recommendations from Delhivery Data Analysis

**Key Insights:**
- Busiest Routes: Bengaluru to Bengaluru had the highest trip count, followed by Bangalore to Bengaluru and Bhiwandi to Mumbai.
- Delivery Delays: Actual trip durations were often longer than estimated due to traffic, loading/unloading delays, and checkpoint stops.
- Routing Inefficiencies: Drivers often took shorter routes than OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) estimates, suggesting outdated routing data.
- Peak Hours & Weekly Trends: Deliveries peaked at 10 AM and 8-11 PM, with the highest demand on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and the lowest on Sundays.
- Outliers in Travel Time: Some trips took significantly longer, indicating operational inefficiencies and potential traffic bottlenecks.

**Recommendations:**
- Improve Route Optimization: Update routing algorithms using historical trip data to reflect real-time road conditions and driver preferences.
- Optimize Peak Hour Scheduling: Increase workforce and vehicle availability during peak hours to meet demand efficiently.
- Enhance Traffic Prediction Models: Use real-time traffic data and machine learning models to adjust estimated delivery times.
- Reduce Cost Inefficiencies: Address long trip durations by minimizing idle time, optimizing warehouse operations, and reducing checkpoint delays.
- Improve Data Accuracy: Regularly update OSRM data to reflect newly built roads, closures, and alternate routes.
- These insights and recommendations help Delhivery streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve delivery efficiency.
